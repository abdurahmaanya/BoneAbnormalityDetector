# App for detectÄ±ng abnormal bones from X-ray images.

1. For the app to work the zip file containing the best model's weights must be put in the same directory as "commons.py". the file should be named "model_best.pth.tar". 

2. If you do not want to go through training, download the best model via https://drive.google.com/file/d/17tCQcpdSB26yh3dqA9Kz8fkgPQObFn9O/view?usp=sharing under       the folder  "MSDNet-PyTorch/weights/save_models/" .

   Otherwise, visit https://github.com/abdurahmaanya/bone-abnormality-detection-using-msdnet.git to train/tweak the model to your preference.
